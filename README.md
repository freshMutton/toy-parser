**A toy parser-combinator**

A toy JSON parser in OCaml.

This attempts to merge [Scott Wlaschin's talk](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/parser/) with the [slides from a presentation on PCL](https://lprousnth.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/pcl.pdf).

**TODOS:**

* let rec bindings working with partial application
* better error messages
* lazy input
* pretty printer
